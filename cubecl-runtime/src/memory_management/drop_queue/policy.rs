/// The staged-allocation count a flush triggers at, overridable at runtime.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A KNOB AND WHAT IT MEASURES. A flush waits on the fence from the
/// PREVIOUS flush cycle, so it blocks the launching thread until the device has
/// drained to a point one batch back. That wait needs no VALUE from the device
/// -- it exists only so staging buffers two batches old can be freed -- which
/// makes it queue-depth SERIALISATION rather than a data dependency, and
/// therefore recoverable. The two are indistinguishable in a profile: both are
/// `cuEventSynchronize` on the launching thread.
///
/// The default of 64 was chosen against uploads of ordinary size. A decode step
/// of this model stages roughly 483 of them -- one per launch that binds a
/// ranked tensor, each carrying that tensor's shape and stride list, 19280
/// bytes for the whole step -- so the count threshold fires about seven times a
/// step while the 64 MiB size threshold never fires at all. Raising the count
/// is the A/B that says how much of the blocked time is serialisation, in one
/// binary and one flag, and it costs only that many small pinned buffers held
/// one cycle longer.
